# The machine learning models were trained in Jupyter Notebooks using csv files. It is all archived in the same directory as the app in the 'Machine Learning Notebooks' folder.
# To train the ML Models, 2 main databases were used. Sleep quality information was retrieved from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset?resource=download
# To train for day ratings (leisure and performance), day distributions were randomnly generated (100 days) and manually rated for both ratings.

# It collects user information (e.g., sleep data, personal details) and provides insights into time management and sleep quality.
